# Quick Math Quiz Game

Welcome to the Quick Math Quiz Game! This Python-based game challenges players with basic arithmetic questions. Each session randomly presents a single question from four possible math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Your goal is to answer correctly using the options provided.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This game is compatible with Python 3.x. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Download the Game**: Download the game files from the repository. If the game is hosted on GitHub, you can clone it using Git with the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Adriex9/pythonquizz-Montreer_Adrien-DIA5.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Game Directory**: After cloning or downloading, navigate to the game directory in your terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash
    cd quick-math-quiz
    ```

### Running the Game

To start the game, run the main script `quiz_game.py` (assuming this is the name of your main game file) in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python quiz_game.py
```

## How to Play

- Once the game starts, you'll be presented with a math question and four possible answers labeled `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
- Input the letter corresponding to your answer choice and press Enter.
- If your answer is correct, the game will congratulate you and terminate.
- If your answer is incorrect, you'll be prompted to try again. The game provides feedback if you input an option outside of `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, reminding you to choose a valid option.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues starting the game, here are a few things to check:
- **Python Version**: Verify you have Python 3.x installed by running `python --version` in your terminal or command prompt.
- **Correct Directory**: Ensure you're in the correct directory where `quiz_game.py` is located before trying to run the script.
